> Python package for performing quality control (QC) for data coordination (DC)

This Python package provides a framework for performing quality control (QC) on data files. Quality control can range from low-level integrity checks (_e.g._ MD5 checksum, file extension) to high-level checks such as conformance to a format specification and consistency with associated metadata.

# PyScaffold

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.3. For details and usage
